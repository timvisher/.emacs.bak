rcirc Manual
************

   `rcirc' is an Emacs IRC client.

   IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a multi-user chat protocol.  Users
communicate with each other in real-time.  Communication occurs both in
topic channels which are collections of many users, or privately, with
just one other user.

1.1 Internet Relay Chat
=======================

"Internet Relay Chat" (IRC) is a form of instant communication over the
Internet.  It is mainly designed for group (many-to-many) communication
in discussion forums called channels, but also allows one-to-one
communication.

   Contrary to most Instant Messenger (IM) systems, users usually don't
connect to a central server.  Instead, users connect to a random server
in a network, and the servers share information between them.

   Here's a typical example:

   When you connect to the Freenode network (`http://freenode.net/'),
you point your IRC client at the server `irc.freenode.net'.  That
server will redirect your client to a random server on the network,
such as `zelazny.freenode.net'.

   Once you're connected, you can send messages to all other users
connected to the same network, and you can join all channels on the same
network.  You might join the `#emacs' and the `#rcirc' channels, for
example.  (Typically, channel names begin with a hash character.)

   Once you have joined a channel, anything you type will be broadcast
to all the other users on the same channel.

   If you want to address someone specifically, for example as an
answer to a question, it is customary to prefix the message with the
nick followed by a colon, like this:

     deego: fsbot rules!

   Since this is so common, you can use <TAB> to do nick completion.


File: rcirc,  Node: Getting started with rcirc,  Prev: Internet Relay Chat,  Up: Basics

1.2 Getting started with rcirc
==============================

Use the command `M-x irc' to connect using the defaults.  *Note
Configuration::, if you want to change the defaults.

   Use `C-u M-x irc' if you don't want to use the defaults, eg. if you
want to connect to a different network, or connect to the same network
using a different nick.  This will prompt you for four things:

IRC server
     What server do you want to connect to? All the servers in a
     particular network are equivalent.  Some networks use a
     round-robin system where a single server redirects new connections
     to a random server in the network.  `irc.freenode.net' is such a
     server for the Freenode network.  Freenode provides the network
     "for the Free and Open Source Software communities, for
     not-for-profit organisations and for related communities and
     organizations."

IRC port
     All network connections require a port.  Just as web servers and
     clients use port 80 per default, IRC uses port 6667 per default.
     You rarely have to use a different port.

IRC nick
     Every users needs a handle on-line.  You will automatically be
     assigned a slightly different nick if your chosen nick is already
     in use.  If your `user-login-name' is `alex', and this nick is
     already in use, you might for example get assigned the nick
     `alex`'.

Channels
     A space separated list of channels you want to join when
     connecting.  You don't need to join any channels, if you just want
     to have one-to-one conversations with friends on the same network.
     If you're new to the Freenode network, join `#emacs', the channel
     about all things Emacs, or join `#rcirc', the channel about
     `rcirc'.

   When you have answered these questions, `rcirc' will create a server
buffer, which will be named something like `*irc.freenode.net*', and a
channel buffer for each of the channels you wanted to join.

   To talk in a channel, just type in what you want to say in a channel
buffer, and press <RET>.

   If you want to paste multiple lines, such as source code, you can use
`C-c C-c' to edit your message in a separate buffer.  Use `C-c C-c' to
finish editing.  You still need to press <RET> to send it, though.
Generally, IRC users don't like people pasting more than around four
lines of code, so use with care.

2.1 rcirc commands
==================

This is a list of commands that you may use in `rcirc'.  It is not
complete.  For a complete listing, press `C-h m' in an `rcirc' buffer.

   In addition to using regular Emacs key bindings, you can call them by
typing them into an `rcirc' buffer.

   For instance, instead of using the command `C-c C-j' to join a new
channel, you may type this in an `rcirc' buffer, and press <RET>:

     /join #emacs

   This is why you cannot start a message with a slash.  You will have
to precede the command with a space, or rewrite your message in order to
send it to a channel.

   Many commands take parameters.  IRC commands usually ignore string
delimiters.  Neither quote nor double-quote have special meanings in
IRC.

     /nick "alex schroeder"

   This will try to change your nick to `"alex'.  Usually this will
fail because the double quote character is not a valid character for
nicks.

   These commands are case insensitive.

   If a command isn't known by `rcirc', it will simply be sent along to
the server.  There is a list of some useful commands like that in the
next section.

`C-c C-j'
     This joins a channel such as `#rcirc' or `#emacs'.  On most
     networks, anybody can create new channels.  If you want to talk
     with some friends, for example, all you have to do is agree on a
     valid channel name and join that channel.  (Also `/join #emacs'.)

`C-c C-p'
     This leaves the current channel.  You can optionally provide a
     reason for parting.  When you kill a channel buffer, you
     automatically part the corresponding channel.  (Also `/part you
     are too weird!'.)

`C-c C-r'
     This changes your nick to some other name.  Your nick must be
     unique across the network.  Most networks don't allow too many
     nick changes in quick succession, and have restrictions on the
     valid characters in nick names.  (Also `/nick alex-test')

`C-c C-w'
     Gives you some basic information about a nick.  This often
     includes what other channels people are on.  (Also `/whois fsbot'.)

`C-c C-q'
     Starts a one-to-one conversation with another person on the same
     network.  A new buffer will be created for this conversation.  It
     works like a channel with only two members.  (Also `/query fsbot'.)

`C-c <RET>'
     This sends a single message to a nick.  Like with `C-c C-q', a new
     buffer is created, where the response from the other party will
     show up.  (Also `/msg nickserv identify secret'.)

`C-c C-x'
     This disconnects from the server and parts all channels.  You can
     optionally provide a reason for quitting.  When you kill the server
     buffer, you automatically quit the server and part all channels.
     (Also `/quit ZZZzzz...'.)

   Some commands may not have a key binding, but only be available as
typed commands, such as:

`/ignore'
     This command toggles the ignore status of a nick, if you provide
     one.  If you don't provide a nick, the command lists all the nicks
     you are ignoring.  All messages by ignored nicks are--you guessed
     it--ignored.  Since only "operators" can kick people from
     channels, the ignore command is often the only way to deal with
     some of the more obnoxious fellows online.  Example: `/ignore xah'.

2.2 Useful IRC commands
=======================

As mentioned, if a command isn't known by `rcirc', it will simply be
sent along to the server.  Some such commands are available on nearly
all IRC servers, such as:

`/away'
     This sets your status as "being away" if you provide a reason, or
     sets your status as "being back" if you do not.  People can use the
     `C-c C-w' command to check your status.  Example: `/away food'.

   Typical IRC servers implement many more commands.  You can read more
about the fantastic world of IRC online at the Internet Relay Chat
(IRC) help archive (http://www.irchelp.org/).


File: rcirc,  Node: Configuration,  Prev: Useful IRC commands,  Up: Reference

2.3 Configuration
=================

These are some variables you can change to configure `rcirc' to your
liking.

`rcirc-default-server'
     the default server to connect to.

`rcirc-default-port'
     the default port to connect to.

`rcirc-default-nick'
     the default nick to use.

     (setq rcirc-default-server "irc.mozilla.org"
           rcirc-default-port 6666
           rcirc-default-nick "alx")

   `rcirc-default-user-full-name' is used to set your "real name" on
IRC.  It defaults to `user-full-name'.  If you want to hide your full
name, you might want to set it to some pseudonym.

     (setq rcirc-default-user-full-name "Curious Minds Want To Know")

   `rcirc-startup-channels-alist' is the alist of channels to join when
connecting to a particular network.  An alist is a list of lists.  Each
sublist starts with a regular expression that is compared to the server
address you're connecting to.  The remaining sublist items are the
channels to join.

     (setq rcirc-startup-channels-alist
           '(("\\.freenode\\.net$" "#emacs" "#rcirc" "#wiki")))

   Note the subtle problem, here -- IRC clients connect to servers, and
there is no way of knowing which servers belong to a particular network.
In the example above we're exploiting a naming convention used by within
the Freenode network -- all servers within the network have a host in
the `freenode.net' domain.

   `rcirc-authinfo' is an alist used to automatically identify yourself
on networks.  Each sublist starts with a regular expression that is
compared to the server address you're connecting to.  The second
element in the list is a symbol representing the method to use, followed
by the arguments this method requires.

   Here is an example to illustrate how you would set it:

     (setq rcirc-authinfo
           '(("freenode" nickserv "bob" "p455w0rd")
             ("freenode" chanserv "bob" "#bobland" "passwd99")
             ("bitlbee" bitlbee "robert" "sekrit")))

   And here are the valid method symbols and the arguments they require:

`nickserv'
     Use this symbol if you need to identify yourself as follows when
     connecting to a network: `/msg nickserv identify secret'.  The
     necessary arguments are the nickname you want to use this for, and
     the password to use.

     Before you can use this method, you will have to register your
     nick and pick a password for it.  Contact `nickserv' and check out
     the details.  (Using `/msg nickserv help', for example.)

`chanserv'
     Use this symbol if you need to identify yourself as follows if you
     want to join a particular channel: `/msg chanserv identify
     #underground secret'.  The necessary arguments are the nickname
     and channel you want to use this for, and the password to use.

     Before you can use this method, a channel contact must tell you
     about the password to use.  Contact `chanserv' and check out the
     details.  (Using `/msg chanserv help', for example.)

`bitlbee'
     Use this symbol if you need to identify yourself in the Bitlbee
     channel as follows: `identify secret'.  The necessary arguments
     are the nickname you want to use this for, and the password to use.

     Bitlbee acts like an IRC server, but in fact it is a gateway to a
     lot of other instant messaging services.  You can either install
     Bitlbee locally or use a public Bitlbee server.  There, you need
     to create an account with a password.  This is the nick and
     password you need to provide for the bitlbee authentification
     method.

     Later, you will tell Bitlbee about your accounts and passwords on
     all the other instant messaging services, and Bitlbee will log you
     in.  All `rcirc' needs to know, is the login to your Bitlbee
     account.  Don't confuse the Bitlbee account with all the other
     accounts.

   Most people want a notification when something is said on a channel
they have joined, particularly if they have been addressed directly.
There is a global minor mode that will do this kind of tracking for
you.  All you need to do is switch it on using `M-x
rcirc-track-minor-mode'.  To make this permanent, add the following to
your init file:

     (rcirc-track-minor-mode 1)

   When other people say things in buffers that are currently buried (no
window is showing them), the mode line will now show you the abbreviated
channel or nick name.  Use `C-c C-<SPC>' to switch to these buffers.

   If you prefer not to load `rcirc' immediately, you can delay the
activation of this mode:

     (add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (rcirc-track-minor-mode 1)))

3 Hacking and Tweaking
**********************

Here are some examples of stuff you can do to configure `rcirc'.

* Menu:

* Skipping /away messages using handlers::
* Using fly spell mode::
* Scrolling conservatively::
* Changing the time stamp format::
* Defining a new command::
* Reconnecting after you have lost the connection::


File: rcirc,  Node: Skipping /away messages using handlers,  Next: Using fly spell mode,  Prev: Hacking and Tweaking,  Up: Hacking and Tweaking

3.1 Skipping `/away' messages using handlers
============================================

The IRC protocol specifies how certain events are signaled from server
to client.  These events have numbers and are dealt with using so-called
handlers.  You can override existing handlers by exploiting the naming
convention adopted for `rcirc'.

   Here's how to stop `rcirc' from printing `/away' messages.  Since
`rcirc' doesn't define a 301 handler, you don't need to require `rcirc'
before defining the handler:

     (defun rcirc-handler-301 (process cmd sender args)
       "/away message handler.")


File: rcirc,  Node: Using fly spell mode,  Next: Scrolling conservatively,  Prev: Skipping /away messages using handlers,  Up: Hacking and Tweaking

3.2 Using fly spell mode
========================

The following code activates Fly Spell Mode for `rcirc' buffers:

     (add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                  (flyspell-mode 1)))

   *Note Flyspell mode: (emacs)Spelling, for details.


File: rcirc,  Node: Scrolling conservatively,  Next: Changing the time stamp format,  Prev: Using fly spell mode,  Up: Hacking and Tweaking

3.3 Scrolling conservatively
============================

IRC buffers are constantly growing.  If you want to see as much as
possible at all times, you would want the prompt at the bottom of the
window when possible.  The following snippet uses a local value for
`scroll-conservatively' to achieve this:

     (add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (set (make-local-variable 'scroll-conservatively)
                      8192)))

   *Note Scrolling conservatively: (emacs)Scrolling, for details.


File: rcirc,  Node: Changing the time stamp format,  Next: Defining a new command,  Prev: Scrolling conservatively,  Up: Hacking and Tweaking

3.4 Changing the time stamp format
==================================

`rcirc-time-format' is the format used for the time stamp.  Here's how
to include the date in the time stamp:

     (setq rcirc-time-format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M ")


File: rcirc,  Node: Defining a new command,  Next: Reconnecting after you have lost the connection,  Prev: Changing the time stamp format,  Up: Hacking and Tweaking

3.5 Defining a new command
==========================

Here's a simple new command, `/sv'.  With it, you can boast about your
IRC client.  It shows how you can use `defun-rcirc-command' to define
new commands.

   We're waiting for the definition of this command until `rcirc' is
loaded because `defun-rcirc-command' is not yet available, and without
`rcirc' loaded, the command wouldn't do us much good anyway.

     (eval-after-load 'rcirc
       '(defun-rcirc-command sv (arg)
          "Boast about rcirc."
          (interactive "i")
          (rcirc-send-message process target
                              (concat "I use " rcirc-id-string))))


File: rcirc,  Node: Reconnecting after you have lost the connection,  Prev: Defining a new command,  Up: Hacking and Tweaking

3.6 Reconnecting after you have lost the connection
===================================================

If you're chatting from a laptop, then you might be familiar with this
problem: When your laptop falls asleep and wakes up later, your IRC
client doesn't realise that it has been disconnected.  It takes several
minutes until the client decides that the connection has in fact been
lost.  The simple solution is to use `M-x rcirc'.  The problem is that
this opens an _additional_ connection, so you'll have two copies of
every channel buffer -- one dead and one live.

   The real answer, therefore, is a `/reconnect' command:

     (eval-after-load 'rcirc
       '(defun-rcirc-command reconnect (arg)
          "Reconnect the server process."
          (interactive "i")
          (unless process
            (error "There's no process for this target"))
          (let* ((server (car (process-contact process)))
                 (port (process-contact process :service))
                 (nick (rcirc-nick process))
                 channels query-buffers)
            (dolist (buf (buffer-list))
              (with-current-buffer buf
                (when (eq process (rcirc-buffer-process))
                  (remove-hook 'change-major-mode-hook
                               'rcirc-change-major-mode-hook)
                  (if (rcirc-channel-p rcirc-target)
                      (setq channels (cons rcirc-target channels))
                    (setq query-buffers (cons buf query-buffers))))))
            (delete-process process)
            (rcirc-connect server port nick
                           rcirc-default-user-name
                           rcirc-default-user-full-name
                           channels))))

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft," which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.


  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document," below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you."  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
     Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
     relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the
     subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque."

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements," "Dedications," "Endorsements," or "History.")
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
     distinct    from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
     History section    of the Document).  You may use the same title
     as a previous version    if the original publisher of that version
     gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
     entities    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified    Version, together with at least five of the principal
     authors of the    Document (all of its principal authors, if it
     has fewer than five),    unless they release you from this
     requirement.
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
     notice    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the    terms of this License, in the form shown in the
     Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section Entitled "History," Preserve its Title,
     and add    to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
     authors, and    publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
     Title Page.  If    there is no section Entitled "History" in the
     Document, create one    stating the title, year, authors, and
     publisher of the Document as    given on its Title Page, then add
     an item describing the Modified    Version as stated in the
     previous sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
     K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications,"
     Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
       the substance and tone of each of the contributor
     acknowledgements    and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements."  Such a section
     may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
     "Endorsements"    or to conflict in title with any Invariant
     Section.
     O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements," provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
     of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements," and any sections Entitled "Dedications."  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements,"
     "Dedications," or "History," the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
     or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
     with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
     Free Documentation License.''

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
     LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
